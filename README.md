# NLP_CS60075
This repo is part of NLP course. The Viterbi code contains the Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging from scratch and also
a way to integrate it with sentiment analyser. The sentiment analyser is built using GLOVE(200 dimension) embedding and 
a base line using RandomForest.The underlying obervation was to check if adding POS information improved the sentiment accuracy.
It turns out that it does so, by a marginal amount.
